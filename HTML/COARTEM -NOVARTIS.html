treatment of adults, children and infants with acute, uncomplicated infections due
to P. falciparum or mixed infections including P. falciparum. Because <strong>Coartem</strong>
is effective against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant P. falciparum it is also
recommended for malaria infections acquired in areas where the parasites may be
resistant to other antimalarials.</p><p><h2>Contra-indicações de <strong>Coartem</strong></h2><strong>Coartem</strong> treatment is contraindicated during the first trimester of
pregnancy. During the second and third trimester, treatment should only be
considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the foetus.
<strong>Coartem</strong> is contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to the active
substances or any of the excipients, in cases of severe malaria, in the first trimester
of pregnancy (see precautions), cardiac arrhythmia, bradycardia, severe cardiac
diseases, QTc prolongation, family history of sudden death, disturbances of
electrolyte balance, e.g. hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia. Concomitant use of
drugs that are known to be metabolised by cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6 or drugs
that are known to prolong the QTc interval.
<strong>Coartem</strong> is not indicated for prophylaxis, or for treating severe malaria,
including cerebral malaria, or malaria with pulmonary oedema or renal failure.
<strong>Coartem</strong> is not indicated for and has not been evaluated in, the treatment of
malaria due to P. vivax, P. malariae or P. ovale. <strong>Coartem</strong> is active against the
blood stages of P. vivax, but is not active against hypnozoites. Therefore, an 8-
amino-quinoline derivative such as primaquine should be given sequentially after
<strong>Coartem</strong> in cases of mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax to achieve
hypnozoites eradication.</p><p><h2>Reações adversas / Efeitos colaterais de <strong>Coartem</strong></h2>A causal relationship with the use of <strong>Coartem</strong>ether could not be excluded for the
following adverse events (ranked in descending order of frequency):
